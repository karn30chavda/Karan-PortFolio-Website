## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
*   npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/karn30chavda/karanchavda-portfolio-website.git
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or if you use yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, typically on `http://localhost:9002` (as per your `package.json`). Open this URL in your browser to see the application.

### Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```
This will generate an optimized build of your application in the `.next` folder.

## Deployment

This Next.js application can be easily deployed to various platforms that support Node.js applications, such as:

*   [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
*   [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (from the creators of Next.js)
*   Firebase Hosting (with Cloud Functions or Cloud Run for Next.js features)

For Netlify and Vercel, you can usually connect your GitHub repository directly, and they will handle the build and deployment process automatically.
